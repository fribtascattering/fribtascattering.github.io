# Training in Advanced Low-Energy Nuclear Theory

### Course 8. Atomic Nuclei as Open Quantum Systems: Unifying Nuclear Structure and Reactions
Institute for Nuclear Theory (INT) at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA, June 22 to July 10, 2020.  

**Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the school has been cancelled. We are hoping to reschedule it in the next couple of years.**

## Brief description
In this course, students will learn about the fundamental concepts pertaining to the unification of nuclear structure and reaction theory and they will be introduced to state-of-the-art theoretical methods that can be used for weakly bound and unbound nuclear states.

The program of this TALENT school is very relevant to the current and envisioned research with rare isotopes. Experimentalists are encouraged to apply!

This [TALENT](https://fribtheoryalliance.org/TALENT/) school is made possible with generous funding from the Institute for Nuclear Theory [INT](https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/int/home) in Seattle, USA and the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams ([FRIB](https://frib.msu.edu/)), USA.


## Daily schedule
There are two lectures every morning. Each lecture is approximately 2x40 min with a break in the middle.
The afternoons will be devoted to exercise sessions with extra support from the two facilitators.
Students will work on a mix of discussion questions, computer exercises and mini projects.
Every day ends with a wrap-up discussion session.

The organization of a typical course day is as follows:

Time | Activity
------------ | -------------
9.00 - 10.30 | Lecture 1
10.30 - 11.00 | Coffee break
11.00 - 12.30 | Lecture 2
12.30 - 14.00 | Lunch
14.00 - 16.30 | Exercise session with afternoon coffee break
16.30 - 17.30 | Wrap-up


## General conditions
As for previous TALENT schools, the lodging and board of students will be covered. Participants will be free to explore Seattle during the weekends. See the application link provided below for details.

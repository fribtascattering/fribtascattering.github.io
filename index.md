## Brief description

This is an intensive summer-school on scattering theory, with the aim to cover aspects that are seldom covered in depth in typical graduate courses. In particular, it will cover the formal theory of resonances and is therefore of high relevance for Science at FRIB.


## Teachers and local organization

### Lecturers/Organizers: 
- Sebastian K&ouml;nig, North Carolina State University, USA
- Kevin Fossez, FRIB, Michigan State University, and Argonne National Laboratory, USA
- Heiko Hergert, FRIB, Michigan State University, USA


This [FRIB-TA](https://fribtheoryalliance.org/) school is made possible with generous funding from the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams ([FRIB](https://frib.msu.edu/)), USA.
